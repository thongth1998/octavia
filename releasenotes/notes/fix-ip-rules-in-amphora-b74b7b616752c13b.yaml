    Fixed a bug that could have made the VIP port unreachable because of the
    removal of some IP rules in the Amphora. It could have been triggered only
    when sending a request from a subnet that is not the VIP subnet but that is
    plugged as a member subnet.

    A patch that fixes an issue making the VIP port unreachable because of
    missing IP rules requires an update of the Amphora image.
