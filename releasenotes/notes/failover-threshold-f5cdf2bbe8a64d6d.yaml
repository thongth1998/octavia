    A new configuration option ``failover_threshold`` can be set to limit the
    number of amphorae simultaneously pending failover before halting the
    automatic failover process. This should help prevent unwanted mass failover
    events that can happen in cases like network interruption to an AZ or the
    database becoming read-only. This feature is not enabled by default, and it
    should be configured carefully based on the size of the environment.
    For example, with 100 amphorae a good threshold might be 20 or 30, or
    a value greater than the typical number of amphorae that would be expected
    on a single host.
