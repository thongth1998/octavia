features:
  - |
    The cpu-pinning element for the amphora image sets the kernel bootarg
    nohz_full=1-N to enable
    full dynticks on all CPUs except the first one (on single CPU images this
    will have no effect). This should reduce kernel noise on those CPUs to a
    minimum and reduce latency.
upgrade:
  - |
    In order for the full dynticks optimization to become effective a new 
    amphora image needs to be built with the new optional CPU pinning 
    feature enabled.
