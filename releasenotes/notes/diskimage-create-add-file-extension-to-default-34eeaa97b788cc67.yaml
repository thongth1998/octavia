upgrade:
  - |
    The default for the output file has been changed in
    diskimage-create.sh. It is now amphora-x64-haproxy.qcow2 instead of
    amphora-x64-haproxy.
fixes:
  - |
    diskimage-create.sh used $AMP_OUTPUTFILENAME.$AMP_IMAGETYPE for
    constructing the image file path when checking the file size, which was
    not correct and caused an "No such file or directory" error.
