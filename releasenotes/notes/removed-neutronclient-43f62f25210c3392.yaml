upgrade:
  - |
    Authentication settings for Neutron should be added
    directly to the [neutron] section of the configuration now. The exact
    settings depend on the `auth_type` used. Refer to
    https://docs.openstack.org/keystoneauth/latest/plugin-options.html
    for a list of possible options.
deprecations:
  - |
    In a future release Octavia will no longer take the authentication
    settings for Neutron from the [service_auth] as a fallback. It will
    require them to be in the [neutron] section. The *endpoint* option is now
    deprecated and replaced by *endpoint_override*. Similarly, the
    new name of the *endpoint_type* option is now *valid_interfaces* and
    the new name of the *ca_certificates_file* option is now *cafile*.
    Note that [service_auth]
    settings will still be used for other services like Nova and Glance.
other:
  - |
    Replaced code that uses the deprecated python-neutronclient library with
    code that uses openstacksdk and removed python-neutronclient as a
    dependency.
