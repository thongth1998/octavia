    When a HTTPS termination listener gets configured, Octavia will tweak the
    HAProxy `tune.ssl.cachesize` setting to use about half of the available
    memory (free + buffers + cached) on the amphora minus the memory needed
    for network sockets based on the global max connections setting.
    This allows to make better reuse of existing SSL sessions and
    helps to lower the number of computationally expensive SSL handshakes.
