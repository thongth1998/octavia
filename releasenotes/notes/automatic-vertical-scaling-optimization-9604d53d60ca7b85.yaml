    Amphora agent has been adjusted to complement the vertical scaling
    optimizations implemented in the new cpu-pinning element. If the flavor
    uses multiple vCPUs it will
    configure HAProxy automatically to pin each of its worker threads
    to an individual CPU that was isolated by the element (all vCPUs starting
    from the second one).
