    Added support for HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) for TLS-terminated
    listeners. The API for creating and updating listeners has been extended
    by the optional fields `hsts_max_age`, `hsts_include_subdomains` and
    `hsts_preload`. By default this feature is disabled.
    In order to activate this feature the `hsts_max_age`
    option needs to be set.
